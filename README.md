This software allows the visualisation of acceleration charts based on the application of different forces, Single Pulse or Harmonic, to beams, 
causing the appereance of mechanical vibrations. The beam specificatios can be changed as the user prefers on the 'Beam Settings' page. 
At the moment, only the 'Fixed Time' page is finalized. For both force options, Single Pulse and Harmonic, the user must chose an applying position
and a reading position. The number of beam divisions for the simulation is set also on 'Beam Settings'.
